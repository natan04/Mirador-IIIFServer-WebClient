## Jetty auto deploy changes

If you make any changes to the HTML, Javascript, css (anything apart from the Java files) Jetty will automatically pick up the changes so a browser refresh should get the new content. There is no need to restart jetty. If you change any Java files running mvn compile while also running mvn jetty:run jetty will ensure jetty picks up any changes

## Updating Mirador

Mirador is included in the SimpleAnnotationServer to aid quick deployment. If you would like to update Mirador follow the instructions on the [Mirador Site](https://github.com/IIIF/mirador) and copy everything from mirador/build/mirador/* to [src/main/webapp/mirador](../src/main/webapp/mirador).
