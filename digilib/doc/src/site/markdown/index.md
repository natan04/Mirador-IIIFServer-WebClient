## What is digilib?

* `digilib` is a web based client/server technology for images. The image
  content is processed on-the-fly by a Java Servlet on the server side so that
  only the visible portion of the image is sent to the web browser on the client
  side.
* `digilib` supports a wide range of image formats and viewing options on
  the server side while only requiring an internet browser with Javascript and a
  low bandwidth internet connection on the client side.
* `digilib` enables very detailed work on an image as required by
  scholars with elaborate viewing features like an option to show images on the
  screen in their original size.
* `digilib` facilitates cooperation of scholars over the internet and
  novel uses of source material by image annotations and stable references that
  can be embedded in URLs.
* `digilib` facilitates federation of image servers through a standards compliant
  [IIIF](http://iiif.io) image API.
* `digilib` is Open Source Software under the Lesser General Public License,
  jointly developed by the
  [Max Planck Institute for the History of Science](http://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de),
  the [Bibliotheca Hertziana](http://www.biblhertz.it), 
  the [University of Bern](http://philoscience.unibe.ch) and others.
