# A short introduction to digilib

## digilib -- how does it work?

The image server digilib is a state-less web-based client-server
application for interactive viewing and manipulation of images.

## Frontend and Scaler server

digilib consists mainly of two parts, the image server component proper,
called "Scaler" and a client-side part that runs in the users web
browser.

The users browser sends an HTTP request for a certain (zoomed, scaled,
rotated) image to the Scaler server and the server returns the image
data as HTTP response.

To complete the schematics of figure 1 we must also take into account
that the client-side part consisting of HTML and Javascript code has
also been requested and loaded from a frontend-web server into the users
browser.

To date there are several frontend implementations for digilib like the
current "jquery" version that only requires static HTML and Javascript and the
older "greyskin" version (grey buttons, implemented in JSP) that come with
the default [digilib distribution][1] or the "[Zogilib][2]" frontend version 
implemented in ZOPE. 

The frontend-server and the Scaler-server do not have to run
on the same machine and often there are several frontends that use the
same Scaler server.

### Request formats

The format of the HTTP requests for the frontend and the
Scaler server can be completely different. The HTML and Javascript code
of the frontend just has to generate the correct request for the Scaler
to produce the desired image. Most of the current frontend implementations 
share some or all of the parameters with the Scaler API.

### Scaler

The [Scaler API](scaler-api.html) is documented on the digilib.sourceforge.net 
pages. Here is a minimal version:

The Scaler servlet takes parameters in the HTTP request format:
`Scaler/request\_path/?param1=value1&param2=value2&...` Unknown parameters
will be silently ignored.

Recognised parameters:

- `request_path` path to file or directory.
- `fn` path to file or directory. This path will be added to the
    `request_path` behind the servlet name. Either parameter can be
    empty. All paths are relative to the configured base directory 
    (digilib-config parameter `basedir-list`). 
- `pn` page number. Index into the (alphabetically sorted)
    directory given by the path. Starts with 1. Ignored if the path
    points to a file. Default: 1.
- `dw` destination image width (pixels). If omitted the image is
    scaled to fit `dh.`
- `dh` destination image height (pixels). If omitted the image
    is scaled to fit `dw`.
- `wx` relative x offset of the image area to be sent (0 <=
    `wx` <= 1). Default: 0.
- `wy` relative y offset of the image area to be sent (0 <=
    `wy` <= 1). Default: 0.
- `ww` relative width of the image area to be sent (0 <= `ww`
    <= 1). Default: 1.
- `wh` relative height of the image area to be sent (0 <= `wh`
    <= 1). Default: 1.
- The image to be loaded can be specified by the `request_path`
    (deprecated) or the `fn` (preferred) parameter and the optional
    index `pn`
    - if `fn` points to a directory then the file with the index `pn`
        (in alphabetical order according to ASCII) will be loaded
    - if `fn` points to a file (with or without extension) then this
        file will be loaded

The image will be scaled equally in horizontal and vertical direction
such that the resulting image does not exceed the rectangle [`dw`,`dh`].
If only either height or width is given the image is scaled to match
only the given parameter. The size of the resulting image in the other
parameter is determined by the aspect ratio of the image.

An example for a Scaler URL is:
`http://digilib.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/digitallibrary/servlet/Scaler?fn=experimental/digilib-test/images&wh=0.1712&ww=0.1282&wy=0.1681&wx=0.6895&dw=862&dh=904`
such a URL can be used as src attribute to an img element in the
frontend HTML.
